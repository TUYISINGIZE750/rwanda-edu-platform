APPLY FIX ON RENDER DIRECTLY
=============================

Since GitHub push is failing, apply the fix directly on Render:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: rwanda-edu-backend
3. Click: Shell tab
4. Run these commands:

cd /opt/render/project/src/app/api
nano locations.py

5. Find line ~145 (the get_schools_by_district function)
6. Change these two lines:

FROM:
    func.lower(School.province) == func.lower(province_name),
    func.lower(School.district) == func.lower(district_name)

TO:
    func.lower(School.province) == province_name.lower(),
    func.lower(School.district) == district_name.lower(),

7. Save: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X
8. Restart: exit shell, click "Manual Deploy"

TEST:
https://tssanywhere.pages.dev/admin-login
South > Kamonyi = 6 schools

The fix changes func.lower(string) to string.lower()
This fixes the SQL query generation.
