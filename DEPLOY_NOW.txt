SCHOOLS DROPDOWN FIX - READY TO DEPLOY
======================================

THE FIX IS READY. GitHub push is failing due to network.

DEPLOY NOW:
-----------

Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
1. Click on "rwanda-edu-backend" service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" button
3. Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

OR use Render Shell:
1. Go to Shell tab in Render dashboard
2. Run: cd app/api
3. Run: nano locations.py
4. Find line 145-146 and change:
   FROM: func.lower(School.province) == func.lower(province_name)
   TO:   func.lower(School.province) == province_name.lower()
   
   FROM: func.lower(School.district) == func.lower(district_name)
   TO:   func.lower(School.district) == district_name.lower()
5. Save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)
6. Restart service
