- Select: South > Kamonyi = Should show 6 schools
- Select: Kigali city > Gasabo = Should show 2 schools

The fix changes the SQL query from:
  func.lower(School.province) == func.lower(province_name)
To:
  func.lower(School.province) == province_name.lower()

This properly compares the database column with the lowercased parameter.
